  "plot": "In 1987, Swedish industrial music veteran Roger Karmanik founded Cold Meat Industry. Over the next decade, the label grew from a bedroom passion project into a world-renowned record company. However, while CMI expanded rapidly, Karmanik\u2019s underground mindset and work methods remained unchanged. Beset by personal and professional struggles, as well as deteriorating mental health, he eventually hit a wall. CMI was declared bankrupt in 2011. But in 2017, as fans from over 40 countries gathered in Stockholm to celebrate the label\u2019s thirtieth anniversary, something unexpected happened.",
