When told to expect a life in a wheelchair he gives himself two years to get back on his feet - or else he doesn\u2019t want to live. This leads him down a rabbit hole of alternative treatments that sells hope, while the fear of his already fragile relationship ending pushes him to figure out who he really is. He seeks answers in the deep- seated childhood traumas that had pushed him to extreme, self-destructive physical limits. Amidst the darkness, he embarks on an inspiring journey of transformation proving that life\u2019s worth goes far beyond physical abilities.",
